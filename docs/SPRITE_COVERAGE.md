# Sprite/asset coverage — Prism Character Mode

## 2026-07-24 — CORRECTION: overworld coverage was undercounted (engine-native sprites)

Every previous coverage number in this file came from cross-referencing ROWE's
`sprite_report.txt`, which records only art ROWE had **staged for injection**.
That silently undercounts overworld sprites, because most of these characters are
NPCs in the games themselves — **this engine already ships their overworld
graphics**. Prof. Oak is the clearest case: the old survey listed him with no
overworld art at all, while both engine families define him
(`OBJ_EVENT_GFX_PROF_OAK` / `EVENT_OBJ_GFX_OAK`). Referencing an existing
graphics id is not an injection job.

Re-surveyed against pokecrystal (`tools/pokecrystal_donor/constants/sprite_constants.asm`, `SPRITE_*`):

**28 of this repo's 76 characters already have an overworld sprite in the
ROM** and need no art sourced:

Red, Blue, Lance, Bruno, Koga, Brock, Misty, Lt. Surge, Erika, Sabrina,
Blaine, Gary, Ethan, Kris, Will, Karen, Janine, Falkner, Bugsy, Whitney,
Morty, Chuck, Jasmine, Pryce, Clair, Silver, Oak, Elm

Cross-repo, counting the engine tables adds **12 characters the old survey called
empty** — Lyra, Oak, Elm, Birch and eight Frontier Brains (Anabel, Tucker, Greta,
Spenser, Noland, Lucy, Brandon, Palmer) — and reclassifies **54 more** from "needs
injecting" to "already there".

Regenerate with `python3 RadicalRed-Character-Mode/tools/survey_engine_ow.py`
(canonical copy lives in the RR repo; it reads every sibling repo's live
`characters.txt`). Visual summary: the "Character Mode — Sprite Coverage by
Character" artifact.

### Three name collisions deliberately NOT counted

CFRU defines `MARLON`, `PENNY` and `MELONY`, but CFRU is Unbound's engine: its
Marlon is Unbound's own protagonist (`MARLON_PLAYER`, `YOUNG_MARLON`,
`MARLON_ARM`), and the engine has no Gen 9 content at all, so its `PENNY` cannot
be the Paldea character. Matching on name alone would have claimed art that does
not depict our character.

### Still open after this correction

1. **Prism's own 27 original characters** (Bronze, the Palette villains, the
   Rijon/Naljo gym leaders and Elite Four) are NPCs in Prism, so their overworld
   art is in this ROM by definition — but Prism's sprite table has never been
   dumped, so none of it is confirmed. They are correctly marked "in-ROM,
   unsurveyed", not "missing".
2. **The GBA sibling repos' Ash Gray donor art does not apply here.** Those blobs
   are GBA 4bpp + BGR555 LZ77; Prism is a Game Boy Color hack (2bpp, GBC
   palettes). Anything sourced for the anime cast here would have to come from a
   GBC-era donor, and none has been surveyed.
3. Prism's roster is the classic Gen 1/2 cast plus Prism originals, so the
   Gen 6-9 "no GBA-style art exists" problem that dominates the other repos does
   not arise — pokecrystal already covers 28 of the 49 non-original characters.


## 2026-07-25 — CORRECTION 2: "no GBA-style art exists for 3D-era characters" is FALSE

> **Prism-specific caveat, read first.** Prism is a Game Boy Color hack (2bpp, GBC palettes).
> Everything below is GBA 4bpp/BGR555 art, so **none of it is directly usable here** — it is
> recorded because the finding is workspace-wide and because it is reference material if anyone
> ever downconverts. Prism's roster is also the classic Gen 1/2 cast plus Prism originals, so the
> Gen 6-9 gap that drove this search barely applies: only 2 of its characters gain anything.
> pokecrystal already covers 28 of Prism's 49 non-original characters natively (see Correction 1).

The claim stated above (and in every sibling repo's copy of this file) that GBA-style pixel art
"genuinely doesn't exist anywhere (official or fan-made) for 3D-model-era characters" is **wrong**.
A five-agent search of fan-games and ROM hacks found it, and the format was verified by measuring
pixels rather than trusting page descriptions.

### Primary source: Pokémon Emerald Rogue (open source, drop-in format)

`https://github.com/Pokabbie/pokeemerald-rogue` (branch `vanilla`) — a pret/pokeemerald decomp fork.
Its `graphics/trainers/front_pics/` is split into `kalos/` (13), `alola/` (14), `galar/` (11),
`paldea/` (12) and `rival/` (Gen 6-9 subset), plus Gen 1-5 casts. **Format verified locally: every
sampled front pic is 64x64, 4-bit colormap, exactly 16 palette entries** — stock pokeemerald format,
zero conversion. Back pics are 64x320 5-frame sheets; overworld sets are 144x32 (9 x 16x32 frames).

Cross-matched against this repo's live `characters.txt`: **2 of its characters gain a
trainer front pic they did not have**:

Lyra, Silver

Workspace-wide the search takes trainer-pic coverage from 76 to 165 of 236 characters, and the
"nothing at all" group from 92 down to 31.

**Cost: attribution.** The repo has no LICENSE and no CREDITS.md. The only credit trail is its
in-game credits roll (`src/data/credits.h`), which lists ~46 artists under "Additional Sprites"
without saying who drew what — so we can credit the project and that roll, but not per sprite.
Several of those names (Beliot419, princess-phoenix, Zender1752, SageDeoxys) are the same DeviantArt
spriters other searches found independently: the repo is best understood as a pre-converted
aggregation of those galleries.

### Secondary sources worth knowing

- **SwSh Ultimate Plus** (PCL.G -> Jeanstars -> Phantonomy; FireRed + CFRU, BPS-distributed) — the
  "Sword and Shield GBA hack". Real, and our Ash Gray rip recipe would apply unchanged. **Rejected as
  primary**: its own README says *"As a non-original dev, I'm not certain where all of the assets
  came from"*, with exactly one Gen 8 sprite attributed. Correct format, unattributable provenance.
- **darklight177 + RHcks Paldea sheet** (DeviantArt) — 8 Paldea leaders + Geeta, trainer pics AND
  overworld strips, measured GBA-native. Free to use, credit RHcks. Adds overworld art Rogue lacks.
- **RichardPT** (DeviantArt) — the only Alain art anywhere: a complete Gen 3 engine set (front, back,
  walking, running, surfing, fishing, town map, VS Seeker). Free with credit.
- **Kalarie's anime overworlds**, PokéCommunity thread 407124 — includes **Paul**, one of the six
  anime characters previously believed to have no art anywhere. Free with credit; needs a dynamic
  overworld palette patch. NOT yet retrieved or verified.
- **Droid779** (Eevee Expo 284) — Gen III-style overworlds for Mallow, Kiawe, Gladion; author takes
  requests.
- **Beliot419 / mid117 / Zender1752** — broad Gen 7-9 coverage including Sada, Turo, Penny and Arven,
  but DS/Gen 5 style at 80x80. Reference for a redraw, not a drop-in.

### Rejected on measurement (do not re-chase)

- mid117's Scarlet/Violet set: DS/Gen 5 style, not GBA.
- xDracolich's Nemona overworld: genuine Gen 3 art but Essentials scale (30x40 per frame vs GBA's
  16x32).
- PokéCommunity 339994: the Gen 6 block is a to-do list with zero image links.
- PokéCommunity 316888 "Kalos Sprites for GBA": Pokémon species only, and every image is a TinyPic
  link — that domain no longer resolves.
- spherical-ice's "Accurate FireRed Overworld Sprite Resource", referenced in our docs for a year:
  Gen 3 trainer *classes* only, nothing past Gen 3.
- Upstream `rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion`: ships no Gen 6-9 human character art at all. Adding
  Gen 9 *species* is not the same as adding Gen 9 *humans* — this distinction is the easiest way to
  get a wrong answer here.

### Still unresolved

1. **35 of this repo's characters still have no art of any kind.** Workspace-wide the 31 are
   the anime cast (Drew, Zoey, Nando, Trip, Alain, Sawyer, Tobias, Goh, Chloe, the Alola anime
   four), the professors (Rowan, Juniper, Sycamore, Burnet, Samson Oak, Magnolia, Sonia, Laventon,
   Cerise, Sada, Turo), and Guzma, Plumeria, Lusamine, Rose, Dahlia, Darach.
2. **The anime-arc search never finished** — that agent hit a usage limit having just surfaced a
   Pokesho 64x64 GBA trainer gallery described as free material. Unverified lead, not a finding.
   The "is there an Ash Gray equivalent for the Hoenn/Sinnoh/Unova arcs" question is still open.
3. **The Ash Gray overworld dump is still unlabelled**: 152 sprites, 15 identified. Ritchie and
   Tracey are both in that game so their overworld art is very likely already ripped —
   `ow014`/`ow015` are the candidates. Confirmed so far: `ow050` Jessie, `ow051`/`ow052` James,
   `ow064` Nurse Joy.
4. **Nothing has been staged or injected.** This is a sourcing finding only; `sprite_asset_id` is
   still `0xFFFF` everywhere.


## 2026-07-25 — CORRECTION 3: the "never sourced" anime characters were sourced all along

> **Prism caveat, same as Correction 2.** Prism is a Game Boy Color hack (2bpp, GBC palettes);
> everything below is GBA 4bpp art and is **not directly usable here**. It is recorded because the
> finding is workspace-wide. Prism's anime slice is small and pokecrystal already covers its
> classic Gen 1/2 cast natively.

Correction 2 closed the Gen 6-9 gap. This closes the anime gap that predates it. The list
"Drew, Paul, Zoey, Nando, Trip, Lyra — no GBA-style art exists anywhere" has been carried in this
file since 2026-07-23. **Five of the six exist.** Only Trip is genuinely missing.

### Pokesho (ポケしょ), by ポケモア / Pokemore — the find

A Japanese fan site that ran two galleries built explicitly to GBA spec. Not a game: a pure sprite
resource. **Both galleries are retired from the live site**; everything below came from the Wayback
capture of **2018-08-15** and was downloaded and format-verified locally.

- **Trainer gallery** (`dot_battle.html`, 68 sprites) — **64x64, <=16 colours = exact GBA trainer
  front-pic format.** Verified: `b_shuu`/`b_shuu2` = **Drew** (two poses), `b_masato` = Max,
  `b_rokettodan` = the Jessie+Meowth+James trio, plus Harley, Tyson, Robert, anime May, Dawn, and
  Ash/Brock/Misty in Kanto, Hoenn and Sinnoh outfits. Measured 64x64 / 16-colour on every sample.
- **Field gallery** (`dot_field.html`, 302 sprites) — **16x22, 16 colours, FRLG-spec, FRONT-FACING
  FRAME ONLY.** Verified: `f_shinji` = **Paul**, `f_nozomi` = **Zoey**, `f_naoshi` = **Nando**
  (carrying his harp), `f_shuu` = Drew, `f_kojirou` = **solo James**, `f_onnanoko_hgss` = **Lyra**.
  Also Ritchie, Tracey, Reggie, Kenny, Ursula, Morrison, Iris, Cilan, Bianca, Cheren, N.
- **Licence, quoted from the gallery header:** 「GBA風トレーナードット絵を展示しています。
  **フリー素材になります**。」 ("GBA-style trainer pixel art is exhibited here. **These are free
  materials.**") and 「すべて64×64サイズ。透明色合わせて最大16色です。**素材としての使用も可能です**。」
  The still-live FAQ answers 「素材もらってもいいですか！？」 with 「**どうぞどうぞ！！**」
  ("Please, go right ahead!!"). Credit as 「ポケしょ / Pokesho（ポケモア）」.
- **Two real caveats.** (1) The field sprites are ONE FRAME — side and back must be drawn before
  they are usable as walking sprites. (2) The galleries are retired and the author states he deletes
  work he considers lower quality; permission was granted while published, so reusing archived
  copies is a judgement call, not a settled one.

### Supporting anime sources

- **kalarie, PokéCommunity thread 407124** — 73 anime overworld sheets, **all imgur links still
  live**, verified **144x32 = the standard FireRed 9-frame NPC sheet of 16x32 frames, GBA-native
  drop-in**. Has **solo James and solo Jessie**, plus Meowth, Butch, Cassidy, Jenny, Joy, Brock,
  Misty, Oak. Kanto/Orange era only. Licence: *"You're free to use any of these sprites in your
  hack... Be sure to give proper credit though."* Needs Navenatox's Dynamic Overworld Palettes patch.
  **This resource is literally Pokesho's front frames animated into full sheets** (its credits say
  so) — which is the proof-of-workflow for doing the same to Paul, Zoey and Nando.
- **aveontrainer (DeviantArt)** — ~480 deviations; posted at 128x192 but that is a clean 2x upscale
  of a native **64x96 = 16 frames of 16x24**, i.e. a full four-direction walk cycle. Has Drew, Lyra,
  Ritchie, Harley, Morrison, **Alain**, Serena, Iris, Bianca, Dawn, Barry, Clemont. No blanket
  licence; takes overworld commissions — the realistic route for Trip/Zoey/Nando walk cycles.
- **Team Aqua's Asset Repo** (`github.com/TeamAquasHideout/Team-Aquas-Asset-Repo`) — **the cleanest
  licence found anywhere**: *"All assets are both free to use and edit by default, but if any assets
  specifically mention not being free to edit, please respect the author's wishes."* Coverage of our
  roster is thin (Lyra, Iris, Serena/Calem, Dawn, Barry + kalarie's Kanto anime fronts) but prefer it
  wherever it overlaps another source.

### CORRECTION to Correction 2: Paul is NOT in kalarie's resource

Correction 2 recorded Paul as available from PokéCommunity 407124. That was wrong. Paul appears in
that thread only as a **rejected submission** (post #20 by *etique*) — the maintainer turned it down
as *"not really FR Style"* — and the attachment measures 32x48 DS-format frames, not GBA. **Paul's
real source is Pokesho's `f_shinji`.**

### The anime-arc hack question: evidenced NEGATIVE

There is **no GBA anime-arc ROM hack for Sinnoh or Unova**, in existence or in development.
*Advanced Generation* (Hoenn, Emerald) stalled at "Beta One Progress: 30%" and its thread is locked.
*Ash Hoenn Version* claims completion but ships as a **pre-patched .gba only**, which fails our
patch-only rule. *Johto League Showdown* is likewise pre-patched-only. *Ash Z* is a 3DS hack with 3D
models. The Sinnoh/Unova cast art exists as standalone resources, not inside any game.
**Pokémon Fire Ash** (RPG Maker XP + Essentials, PC) is the only known thing containing **Trip** —
its walkthrough confirms Trip, Sawyer, Tobias, Paul, Nando and Zoey as battleable trainers — but it
is not a ROM hack, has no stated asset licence, and **nobody has opened its `Graphics/Trainers`
folder to confirm the sprite format.**

### Where this repo now stands

**8 of its characters still have no art of any kind.** Workspace-wide the remaining 26 are
the eleven professors (Rowan, Juniper, Sycamore, Burnet, Samson Oak, Magnolia, Sonia, Laventon,
Cerise, Sada, Turo), the Alola anime four (Lillie, Kiawe, Lana, Mallow), Guzma, Plumeria, Lusamine,
Rose, Goh, Chloe, Tobias, Sawyer, **Trip**, Dahlia and Darach. Several of the artists found here take
commissions and already work natively in our format.

Workspace totals across the three corrections: overworld 103 -> 131 (plus 31 partial), trainer pics
76 -> 168, back pics 13 -> 18, "nothing at all" 92 -> 26.

Nothing is staged or injected. `sprite_asset_id` is still `0xFFFF` everywhere.


## 2026-07-25 — CORRECTION 4: front and back pics were undercounted too (Frontier Brains, Oak, Blue)

Correction 1 found that **overworld** art was undercounted because the surveys were built from
ROWE's `sprite_report.txt`, which records only art ROWE had *staged for injection*. The same bug
applies to **trainer front pics and back pics**, and it bites hardest for characters added to the
roster after that report was written.

**The Frontier Brains are the clearest case.** All seven Hoenn Brains are battleable trainers in
vanilla Emerald, so `TRAINER_PIC_SALON_MAIDEN_ANABEL`, `DOME_ACE_TUCKER`, `ARENA_TYCOON_GRETA`,
`PALACE_MAVEN_SPENSER`, `FACTORY_HEAD_NOLAND`, `PIKE_QUEEN_LUCY` and `PYRAMID_KING_BRANDON` have
always existed, with real PNGs in the donor tree. Palmer has `TRAINER_PIC_PALMER` in CFRU. They were
recorded as "no art" purely because they joined the roster on 2026-07-24, long after ROWE's survey.
**Anabel, Tucker, Greta, Spenser, Noland, Lucy, Brandon and Palmer all go from 1/3 to 2/3.**
Dahlia and Darach stay at zero — Sinnoh-only Brains, no GBA-era art.

**Two more found the same way, both verified by measuring the files:**
- **Prof. Oak has a front pic in the ROM.** `TRAINER_PIC_PROF_OAK 0x84` in CFRU (so Radical Red and
  Unbound can reference it with no injection at all), and `professor_oak_frlg.png` — 64x64,
  16-colour, verified — in the pokeemerald-expansion tree for Seaglass and Lazarus.
- **`TRAINER_BACK_PIC_RIVAL` is Blue/Gary's back sprite**, sitting unused in CFRU. Engine back
  sprites really are protagonist-only otherwise, which is why this is the sole addition.

### New tool: `tools/survey_engine_assets.py`

Supersedes `survey_engine_ow.py`. Matches every character in every repo's live `characters.txt`
against the CFRU / pokeemerald-expansion / pokecrystal tables for **all three** sprite types, and
strips trainer-class prefixes (`SALON_MAIDEN_`, `LEADER_`, `ELITE_FOUR_`…) so a character matches its
own pic regardless of title. For this repo it reports **ow 28, front 0, back 0**.

Two traps encoded in it, both of which produced wrong answers before being fixed:
1. **pokeemerald keeps back-pic symbols in `src/data/graphics/trainers.h`, not in
   `include/constants/trainers.h`** where the front pics live. Reading the wrong file silently
   reports zero back pics for both Emerald repos.
2. **Those symbols are CamelCase** (`gTrainerBackPic_Brendan`), unlike every other table. An
   uppercase-only capture matches just the leading letter, so `gTrainerBackPic_None` yields `N` —
   which falsely handed a back sprite to the character **N**. Normalise CamelCase before matching.

Known blind spot, documented in the file: an asset that ships as **art but is not wired to a trainer
slot** has no constant to match. That is exactly how `professor_oak_frlg.png` hid on the Emerald
side — the PNG is right there, but no `TRAINER_PIC_*OAK*` constant exists in that donor. When a
character seems to have nothing, check the graphics directories as well as the constants.

### Professors — a structural answer, not just a gap

Professors don't battle, so **front pics were never drawn for them**. That single fact explains the
whole professor gap and is worth remembering before any future search. Exceptions found:
- **Oak** — front pic in-engine (above); for Prism, `pret/pokecrystal/gfx/trainers/oak.png` is
  56x56 4-colour, native Gen 2 format and a direct drop-in.
- **Birch** — `graphics/birch_speech/birch.png` is 64x64 / 16-colour (verified) but is *intro*
  art, not a front-pic table entry; check the palette convention before injecting.
- **Rowan** — `Team-Aquas-Asset-Repo` → `Overworld Trainer Sprites/spilledpizza/.../DP_prof_rowan.png`,
  verified **144x32, 16-colour, with matching .pal**. Clean drop-in under that repo's
  "free to use and edit by default" licence.
- Zero professor front or back pics exist across all 18,299 files of the Team Aqua repo, and GitHub
  code search returns nothing for `TRAINER_PIC_ROWAN`/`JUNIPER`/`SYCAMORE`/`LAVENTON`/`MAGNOLIA`/
  `SONIA`. `OBJ_EVENT_GFX_PROF_ROWAN` has 83 hits but all are `pokeplatinum` — DS assets, a redraw.

**Licence traps flagged:** the only Oak back pic found (Boonzeet, DeviantArt) is **CC BY-NC-ND**, and
ND forbids exactly the 512x192 -> 64x320 re-layout it would need. Wolfang62's professor set gates the
four most wanted: *"Please do not use them (Sycamore, Magnolia, Sonia and Laventon) without my
permission."* aveontrainer has FRLG-style professor overworlds but states no terms at all.

### Where this repo stands

**7 of its characters have no art of any kind.** Workspace-wide: overworld 132 (+31 partial),
front pics 177, back pics 20, complete sets 20, nothing-at-all **25**.

### Search left unfinished — spend limit, not exhaustion

The last round stopped on an account spend limit with three threads mid-verification. Recorded as
**unverified leads, not findings**: a claimed **Lance back sprite**; a **pokefirered fork said to
carry Volo trainer front pics** (Volo is not currently in any roster — a roster decision, not just a
sprite one); and a DeviantArt spriter with 240+ deviations not yet enumerated. Anyone resuming should
start there.

Nothing is staged or injected. `sprite_asset_id` is still `0xFFFF` everywhere.
